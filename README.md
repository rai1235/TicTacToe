# TicTacToe
This is a java code for a simple tic tac toe game. 
In it, a user has to enter the symbol they would like to start with. The chances for the symbols are then automatically assigned. 

In order to enter a symbol, a user must enter the coordinates as per how the boxes are arranged in a 2D array. 
For example, in order to enter a symbol in the middle space, the user must enter coordinates 1 1.
Similarly, to enter it in the middle cell of the bottom row, the user must enter coordinates 2 1.

The program is able to recognize when the game is over automatically and will display a message as such when it happens.
